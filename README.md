Get a sneak peek and influence the product's development process.
Thank you in advance for your feedback and interest!
</i>

This quickstart details several pathways you can work through. 
We encourage you to explore one for Sparsify's full benefits. 
When you finish the quickstart, sparsifying your models is as easy as:

```bash
sparsify.run sparse-transfer --use-case image-classification --data imagenette --optim-level 0.5
```

### 1. Install and Setup

#### 1.1 Verify Prerequisites

First, verify that you have the correct software and hardware to run the Sparsify Alpha.

<details>
<summary>Software</summary>

Sparsify is tested on Python 3.8 and 3.10, ONNX 1.5.0-1.12.0, ONNX opset version 11+, and manylinux compliant systems. 
Sparsify is not supported natively on Windows and MAC OS.

Additionally, for installation from PyPi, pip 20.3+ is required.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hardware</summary>

Sparsify requires a GPU with CUDA + CuDNN in order to sparsify neural networks.
We recommend you use a Linux system with a GPU that has a minimum of 16GB of GPU Memory, 128GB of RAM, 4 CPU cores, and is CUDA-enabled. 
If you are sparsifying a very large model, you may need more RAM than the recommended 128GB. 
If you encounter issues setting up your training environment, [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/issues).
</details>

#### 1.2 Create an Account

Creating a new one-time account is simple and free.  
An account is required to manage your Experiments and API keys.  
Visit the [Neural Magic's Web App Platform](https://account.neuralmagic.com/signup) and create an account by entering your email, name, and unique password. 
If you already have a Neural Magic Account, [sign in](https://account.neuralmagic.com/signin) with your email.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RInSrLsfm0PQLEkjJqD1HzaCWA2yDcNi" alt="Sparsify Sign In" style="height: ; width:400px;"/>

#### 1.3 Install Sparsify

`pip` is the preferred method for installing Sparsify. 
It is advised to create a [fresh virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to avoid dependency issues.

Install with pip using:
```bash
pip install sparsify-nightly
```

#### 1.4 Log in via CLI

Next, with Sparsify installed on your training hardware:
1. Authorize the local CLI to access your account by running the sparsify.login command and providing your API key.
2. Locate your API key on the homepage of the [Sparsify Cloud](https://apps.neuralmagic.com/sparsify) under the 'Get set up' modal, and copy the command or the API key itself.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
sparsify.login API_KEY
```

### 2. Run an Experiment

Experiments are the core of sparsifying a model. 
They allow you to apply sparsification algorithms to a dataset and model through the three Experiment types detailed below: 
- [One-Shot](#21-one-shot)
- [Training-Aware](#22-training-aware)
- [Sparse-Transfer](#23-sparse-transfer)

All Experiments are run locally on your training hardware and can be synced with the cloud for further analysis and comparison, using Sparsify's two components:
- Sparsify Cloud - explore hyperparameters, predict performance, and generate the desired CLI/API command.
- Sparsify CLI/API - run an experiment.

#### 2.1 One-Shot

| Sparsity | Sparsification Speed | Accuracy |
|----------|----------------------|----------|
| **++**   | **+++++**            | **+++**  |

One-Shot Experiments quickly sparsify your model post-training, providing a 3-5x speedup with minimal accuracy loss, ideal for quick model optimization without retraining your model.

To run a One-Shot Experiment for your model, dataset, and use case, use the following command:
```bash
sparsify.run one-shot --use-case USE_CASE --model MODEL --data DATASET --optim-level OPTIM_LEVEL
```

For example, to sparsify a ResNet-50 model on the ImageNet dataset for image classification, run the following commands:
```bash
wget https://public.neuralmagic.com/datasets/cv/classification/imagenet_calibration.tar.gz
tar -xzf imagenet_calibration.tar.gz -C ./imagenet_calibration
sparsify.run one-shot --use-case image_classification --model "zoo:cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenet/base-none" --data ./imagenet_calibration --optim-level 0.5
```

Or, to sparsify a BERT model on the SST2 dataset for sentiment analysis, run the following commands:
```bash
wget https://public.neuralmagic.com/datasets/nlp/text_classification/sst2_bert_calibration.tar.gz
tar -xzf sst2_bert_calibration.tar.gz
sparsify.run one-shot --use-case text_classification --model "zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/base-none" --data --data ./sst2_bert_calibration --optim-level 0.5
```

To dive deeper into One-Shot Experiments, read through the [One-Shot Experiment Guide](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/blob/main/docs/one-shot-experiment-guide.md).

<i>
Note, One-Shot Experiments currently require the model to be in an ONNX format and the dataset to be in a NumPy format.
More details are provided in the One-Shot Experiment Guide.
</i>

#### 2.2 Sparse-Transfer

| Sparsity | Sparsification Speed | Accuracy  |
|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| **++++** | **++++**             | **+++++** |

Sparse-Transfer Experiments quickly create a smaller and faster model for your dataset by transferring from a [SparseZoo](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/) pre-sparsified foundational model, providing a 5-10x speedup with minimal accuracy loss, ideal for quick model optimization without retraining your model.

To run a Sparse-Transfer Experiment for your model (optional), dataset, and use case, run the following command:
```bash
sparsify.run sparse-transfer --use-case USE_CASE --model OPTIONAL_MODEL --data DATASET --optim-level OPTIM_LEVEL
```

For example, to sparse transfer a SparseZoo model to the Imagenette dataset for image classification, run the following command:
```bash
sparsify.run sparse-transfer --use-case image_classification --data imagenette --optim-level 0.5
```

Or, to sparse transfer a SparseZoo model to the SST2 dataset for sentiment analysis, run the following command:
```bash
sparsify.run sparse-transfer --use-case text_classification --data sst2 --optim-level 0.5
```

To dive deeper into Sparse-Transfer Experiments, read through the [Sparse-Transfer Experiment Guide](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/blob/main/docs/sparse-transfer-experiment-guide.md).

<i>
Note, Sparse-Transfer Experiments require the model to be saved in a PyTorch format corresponding to the underlying integration such as Ultralytics YOLOv5 or Hugging Face Transformers.
Datasets must additionally match the expected format of the underlying integration.
More details and exact formats are provided in the Sparse-Transfer Experiment Guide.
</i>

#### 2.3 Training-Aware

| Sparsity  | Sparsification Speed  | Accuracy  |
|-----------|-----------------------|-----------|
| **+++++** | **++**                | **+++++** |

Training-aware Experiments sparsify your model during training, providing a 6-12x speedup with minimal accuracy loss, ideal for thorough model optimization when the best performance and accuracy are required.

To run a Training-Aware Experiment for your model, dataset, and use case, run the following command:
```bash
sparsify.run training-aware --use-case USE_CASE --model OPTIONAL_MODEL --data DATASET --optim-level OPTIM_LEVEL
```

For example, to sparsify a ResNet-50 model on the Imagenette dataset for image classification, run the following command:
```bash
sparsify.run training-aware --use-case image_classification --model "zoo:cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenette/base-none" --data imagenette --optim-level 0.5
```

Or, to sparsify a BERT model on the SST2 dataset for sentiment analysis, run the following command:
```bash
sparsify.run training-aware --use-case text_classification --model "zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/base-none" --data sst2 --optim-level 0.5
```

To dive deeper into Training-Aware Experiments, read through the [Training-Aware Experiment Guide](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsify/blob/main/docs/training-aware-experiment-guide.md).

<i>
Note that Training-Aware Experiments require the model to be saved in a PyTorch format corresponding to the underlying integration such as Ultralytics YOLOv5 or Hugging Face Transformers.
Datasets must additionally match the expected format of the underlying integration.
More details and exact formats are provided in the Training-Aware Experiment Guide.
</i>

### 3. Compare Results

Once you have run your Experiment, the results, logs, and deployment files will be saved under the current working directory in the following format:
```text
[EXPERIMENT_TYPE]_[USE_CASE]_{DATE_TIME}
â”œâ”€â”€ deployment
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ model.onnx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *supporting files*
â”œâ”€â”€ logs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ *logs*
â”œâ”€â”€ training_artifacts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ *training artifacts*
    â”œâ”€â”€ *metrics and results*
```

You can compare the accuracy by looking through the metrics printed out to the console and the metrics saved in the experiment directory.
Additionally, you can use [DeepSparse](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse) to compare the inference performance on your CPU deployment hardware.

<i>
Note: In the near future, you will be able to visualize the results in Sparsify Cloud, simulate other scenarios and hyperparameters, compare the results to other Experiments, and package for your deployment scenario.
</i>

To run a benchmark on your deployment hardware, use the `deepsparse.benchmark` command with your original model and the new optimized model.
This will run a number of inferences to simulate a real-world scenario and print out the results.

It's as simple as running the following command:
```bash
deepsparse.benchmark --model_path MODEL --scenario SCENARIO
```

For example, to benchmark a dense ResNet-50 model, run the following command:
```bash
deepsparse.benchmark --model_path "zoo:cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenette/base-none" --scenario sync
```

This can then be compared to the sparsified ResNet-50 model with the following command:
```bash
deepsparse.benchmark --model_path "zoo:cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenet/pruned95_quant-none" --scenario sync
```

The output will look similar to the following:
```text

```

See the [DeepSparse Benchmarking User Guide](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/blob/main/docs/user-guide/deepsparse-benchmarking.md) for more information on benchmarking.

### 4. Deploy a Model

As an optional step to this quickstart, now that you have your optimized model, you are ready for inferencing. 
To get the most inference performance out of your optimized model, we recommend you deploy on Neural Magic's [DeepSparse](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/deepsparse). 
DeepSparse is built to get the best performance out of optimized models on CPUs.  

DeepSparse Server takes in a task and a model path and will enable you to serve models and `Pipelines` for deployment in HTTP.

You can deploy any ONNX model using DeepSparse Server with the following command:
```bash
deepsparse.server --task USE_CASE --model_path MODEL_PATH
```

Where `USE_CASE` is the use case of your Experiment and `MODEL_PATH` is the path to the deployment folder from the Experiment.

For example, to deploy a sparsified ResNet-50 model, run the following command:
```bash
deepsparse.server --task image_classification --model_path "zoo:cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenet/pruned95_quant-none"
```

If you're not ready for deploying, congratulations on completing the quickstart!

    abstract = {Optimizing convolutional neural networks for fast inference has recently become an extremely active area of research. One of the go-to solutions in this context is weight pruning, which aims to reduce computational and memory footprint by removing large subsets of the connections in a neural network. Surprisingly, much less attention has been given to exploiting sparsity in the activation maps, which tend to be naturally sparse in many settings thanks to the structure of rectified linear (ReLU) activation functions. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of methods for maximizing the sparsity of the activations in a trained neural network, and show that, when coupled with an efficient sparse-input convolution algorithm, we can leverage this sparsity for significant performance gains. To induce highly sparse activation maps without accuracy loss, we introduce a new regularization technique, coupled with a new threshold-based sparsification method based on a parameterized activation function called Forced-Activation-Threshold Rectified Linear Unit (FATReLU). We examine the impact of our methods on popular image classification models, showing that most architectures can adapt to significantly sparser activation maps without any accuracy loss. Our second contribution is showing that these these compression gains can be translated into inference speedups: we provide a new algorithm to enable fast convolution operations over networks with sparse activations, and show that it can enable significant speedups for end-to-end inference on a range of popular models on the large-scale ImageNet image classification task on modern Intel CPUs, with little or no retraining cost.}
