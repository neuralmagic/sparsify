# Welcome to Sparsify

Sparsify improves model performance for deployment at scale using the latest model compression techniques. Use Sparsify to analyze, optimize, and integrate your neural network for production.

Sparsify is a deep learning model acceleration tool suite that simplifies the model optimization process to rapidly achieve the best combination of size, speed, and accuracy on any deep learning model. Sparsify is an easy way to optimize and benchmark models informed by industry research insights for ML practitioners, including ML engineers and operators, who need to deploy performant deep learning models at scale. Sparsify provides visual performance potential for your model, including a sliding scale between performance and loss.
